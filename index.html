		<h1 align="center">Progress</h1>
		<p>At its most basic level, <em>progress</em> is the transition from one stage of work to another.</p>
		
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Work. Progress requires hard and constant work in order to fully transition from one stage of development to another.</p>
		
		<h2>Rewards</h2>
		<p>Depending on what progress is related to, there may be different rewards for each stage that you complete.<p>
		<p>For example: if you were to be weeding your flower garden (or vegetable garden), which is loaded with weeds to the
			point that you can't even see the flowers/vegetables, your work would likely become noticeable after a very short amount of time. 
			After seeing the <i>progress</i> that you have already accomplished, you would likely become more encouraged and determined
			to finish the job.</p>
		<h3>Feelings</h3>
		<p>Quite often, you will often have feelings concerning the progress which you continue to make on progress. Some of the most common feelings are:</p>
		<ul type="disk">
			<li>Excitement</li>
			<li>Determination</li>
			<li>A sense of accomplishment (if that can be concidered a feeling)</li>
			<li>Successful</li>
			<li>Happiness</li>
			<li>Joyfulness</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The list could go on; these are only some of the immediate rewards of progress.</P>
